\title{C++ Function for Solving the PLAC Estimator.
(with time-dependent convariates independent of A^*)}
\usage{
PLAC_Tv(Z, ZFV_, X, W, Ind1, Ind2, Dn, b, h, K = 100L)
}
\arguments{
\item{Z}{matrix for all the covariates history.}

\item{ZFV_}{matrix for all covariates at the each individual's
observed survival time.}

\item{X}{the response matrix (As, Xs, Ds).}

\item{W}{the ordered observed event times.}

\item{Ind1}{risk-set indicators.}

\item{Ind2}{truncation pair indicators.}

\item{Dn}{number of ties at each observed event time.}

\item{b}{initial values of the regression coefficients.}

\item{h}{initial values of the baseline hazard function.}

\item{K}{maximal iteration number, the default is \code{K = 100}.}
}
\value{
list of model fitting results for both conditional approach and
the PLAC estimator.
