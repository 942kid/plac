## Resubmission

This is a resubmission for package **plac**.

Changes this version (v0.1.3):

* Reduce sample sizes in data generation examples


## R CMD check Results

We used GitHub Actions to run `R CMD check` on different operating systems and R version.

There were no ERROR or WARNING.

There was 1 NOTE on Linux:

* checking installed package size ... NOTE
  installed size is 31.4Mb
  sub-directories of 1Mb or more:
  libs  31.2Mb

This because of the compiled source code.

## Reverse Dependencies

None.
